# In No Particular Order 

#### AirPods <> FaceTime interaction increasingly becoming an open joke.

#### `lldb` being unable to inspect local Swift variables in 2024. Swift was released almost a decade ago.

#### Entirety of Xcode's "Add Package Dependencies" UI. The search bar's text input still missing a debounce despite years into release.

#### `StartDiveIntent`. (SiriKit overall along with the gutting AppleScript about 5-7 years too early). 

#### Messages app search indexing (or lack thereof).

#### Xcode

#### `NSTrackingSeparatorToolbarItem` which was added the same year SwiftUI app lifecycle released, is still not available from SwiftUI.

#### Focus state management in SwiftUI. Or out of SwiftUI. Anything to do with responder chain in macOS feels intentionally designed to traumatize developers.

PRs welcomed (merging is at the discretion of my personal amusement).
